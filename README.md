👋 Hi, there!
My name is Dallas Gagnon and I am a business-trending reporter for MassLive.com. 

🌱 Based in "The Heart of the Commonwealth," I am responsible for covering anything from business openings and closing, to layoffs, recalls and more.   

💞️ My goal is to fairly and accurately represent the communities I serve while ensuring community members feel their voices are heard.

📫 You can reach me on my business email at DGagnon@MassLive.com or sending a message to 413-544-0624. 

😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: I acheived my B.A from Framingham State University in 2022.
I am currently working towards acheiving a B.S in Communication from the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.
